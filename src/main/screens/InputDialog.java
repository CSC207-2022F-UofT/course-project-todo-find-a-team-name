/**
 * A class storing the attributes and the creation mechanism for an input dialog. Specifically for overlap max.
 * Note that the view must be drawn/presented by using a showXXXdialog() method, or by setting it visible manually.

 Inherits from JOptionPane -- which is basically our InputDialog abstract class (now obsolete).

 Also determines how it's drawn at the moment. I think the presenter can be the one that actually draws it,
 but this one will determine basically the layout.
